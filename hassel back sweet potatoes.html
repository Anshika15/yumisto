<ul><b>Ingredients Of Hassel Back Sweet Potatoes</b>
<li>4 Medium Sweet Potatoes</li>
<li>6 Tbsp Unsalted Butter</li>
<li>1/3 Cup Brown Sugar</li>
<li>1 tsp Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
<li>1/2 tsp Ground Cinnamon</li>
<li>1/2 tsp Himalayan Pink Salt / Rock salt</li>
</ul>
<ol><b>How to Make Hassel back Sweet Potatoes</b>
<li>Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
<li>Shave a thin sliver from one side of each potato to give it a flat surface to stand on while you slice it. Make thin slices into the potato about 1/16-inch thick, stopping before you cut all the way through. (Placing a chopstick on either side of the potato while you slice it can help stop the blade before it cuts all the way through.)</li>
<li>Put each potato on a separate sheet of foil. Shape the foil around the potatoes to wrap them, but leave the tops open and exposed.</li>
<li>Put the potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
<li>Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat, swirling occasionally, until browned and nutty, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir in the brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and salt. Drizzle the butter mixture over the potatoes and pinch the foil together on top to seal the potato inside.</li>
<li>Bake for 45 minutes, then let cool for a few moments. Remove the potatoes from the foil, put them on a serving platter and drizzle with the sauce leftover in each foil packet.</li>
<li>Sprinkle some nuts while serving.</li>
