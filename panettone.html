<ul><b>Ingredients Of Panettone</b>
<li>250 Gram Flour T-45</li>
<li>10 Gram Fresh Yeast</li>
<li>75 Gram Castor Sugar</li>
<li>155 Gram Milk</li>
<li>75 Gram Whole Eggs</li>
<li>20 Gram Egg Yolks</li>
<li>80 Gram Butter, unsalted</li>
<li>2.5 Gram Bread Improver</li>
<li>3.5 Gram Salt</li>
<li>80 Gram Raisins</li>
<li>80 Gram Candied Orange</li>
<li>35 Gram Candied Lemon</li>
<li>35 Gram Red Cherries</li>
</ul>
<ol><b>How to Make Panettone</b>
<br>Prepare the sponge:
<li>Take a small bowl. Pour warm 30 gm of milk and add 5gm yeast to it.</li>
<li>Let it stand until yeast has dissolved. Stir in 30g of the flour, cover with cling film, and let stand 30 minutes, or until doubled.</li>
<li>Beat sugar, egg yolks & whole eggs together. Add to sponge and stir until well incorporated.</li>
<li>Combine butter and remaining flour until crumbly. Slowly pour in egg mixture.</li>
<li>Add in the rest of the ingredient except the fruits and beat on high speed 3 to 4 minutes, until dough is elastic looking and long strands form. Beat in candied fruit and raisins.</li>
<li>Take the dough into greased bowl, cover with cling film, and leave in a warm place to rise until doubled again, about 2 hours.</li>
<li>Once proofed take out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead a few times to deflate.</li>
<li>Divide dough into 2 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and drop into prepared moulds. Let rise in a warm place for about two hours, until doubled again.</li>
<li>Heat oven to 200 C. Cut an X on top of each loaf with oiled scissors/blade. Brush tops of loaves lightly with egg wash.</li>
<li>After 10 minutes, lower heat to 190 C. Bake for 30 more minutes; if tops get too brown, cover with foil.</li>
<li>Loaves are done when a wooden skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool on wire rack.</li>
<li>Serve.</li>
